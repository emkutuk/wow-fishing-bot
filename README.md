# World of Warcraft Shadowlands Fishing Bot

This is a fishing bot that I made for myself but then decided to make it public for people who may need the same thing. I personally haven't used this bot to fish thousands of fish but have used it to be able to eat while watching my character fish. 

Use it with your own risk!

## How It Works

First you choose the bopper image according to the place you are fishing at. Images are located under "media" folder. In the code you can change it in main.py file.

What the program does is basically takes a screehsot of your screen, checks if the bobber is visible or not then waits for it to go under the water. When that happens it goes and clicks the bobber.

## What You Need to Make It Work

- You need to be able to run python scripts.
- You need to place fishing skill on your action bar (bot will press '1' to fish).
- You need to activate auto-loot.
- You MAY need to upload new pictures of boppers.
- You MAY need to change your graphic quality to 1(lowest setting).

## Safe Fishing Everyone!
